# the-genesis
how did it all start, what is the origin story, why did it all happen?

Programming languages were derived from human languages. 
Can we reverse this and create stories based on the patterns and culture which evolved around programming? 

How can we fuse writing for humans with writing for machines?
How will a story for a virtual reality based film be created and sound like?

What tools do we need to write soft-humanbrains-ware? Do we need to skip all know programming patterns and languages all together, are they just holding us back in development?

Will one day an neuronic AI just read all the books we have today, watch all the movies we created and start telling us stories?

#How does today development translate into a story and into the way we write this story?

##the tools and the setting to write the story
- the story should be version based, (so everything any author anytime wrote, will be visible forever)
- is told by different people around the world and
- is created together in an agile process.

##the bits and pieces of the story
- The story is not linear, the story works in very different ways.
- It has a simple set of characters & objects with a lot of attributes, actions and events. These are hold together and connected by the purpose they are all following and are made for. The plot.
- There are different languages and dialects as there are different writers and styles.
- It will have bugs & flows and maybe too many features. 
- And the story is written to be used, to be read, to be re-told and forked into new stories.


#How can we write a great story, together?
It might get very complex to understand how the story and everything connects and works together, so we need some good rules and tools to write a great story together. It might get lame and boring, how can we them stick and inspire the reader?

#The Vision, the mission, the spirit
Every group needs some rules of cooperation. And everything living being needs freedom to create. Freedom to make mistakes while trying to improve on what is there. 
To cooperate together we need a vision, a shared purpose we are all doing this for. 

#the vision
One day, all our stories, identities and minds will be interconnected and create something bigger than us. We will find purpose in our lives and make peace between us humans, with the other animals around us and the earth we are living on. 
We will continue to build and create amazing and beautiful things, living things out of biological and mechanical parts.
Our quest to understand the world around us will bring us into even deeper levels, lets us discover bigger and radical different worlds, realities and dimensions. 
Our consciousness will grow, become deeper in its understanding and wider in its vision.
